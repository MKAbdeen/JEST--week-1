# Sudoku
sudoku in python

# the only thing left to do is start the game from index 1 instead of 0
#to play the game please notice that :
# the top left cell (first cell) exists in the (0,0) and not (1,1)
#the last cell (8,8)
#the '|' and '-' do't have indexes.
#example: Set x y z -> Set 4 6 1 -> sets the cell in the 4th column and the 6th row to 1
